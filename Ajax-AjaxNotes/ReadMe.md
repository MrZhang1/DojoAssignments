# Notes - Ajax Assignment

### What works:
+ Front-end
  - Single Page to show notes and form for adding new notes
  - Partial for refreshing the displayed notes

+ Back-end
  - ERD, Schema generation and Setup
  - Used same Db / Table from the Posts assignment

+ Controllers and Models
  - Notes / Note (controller / model) for handling the CRUD

+ UX
  - Show list of existing notes on loading the page
  - Click the "+" sign on any existing note to add a new note
  - Click the "x" sign on any existing note to delete it
  - Click on the body of the note to enter edit mode. Edited note is saved when cursor is moved from the note / mouse is clicked anywhere outside the note
  - If there are no notes, the "add note" form will become automatically visible.

### What doesn't work:
+ The notes don't have titles.
