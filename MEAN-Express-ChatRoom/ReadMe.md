# Express + Socket.io - Chat Room

### What works:
  - [x] Pseudo Login page as the default home page
  - [x] Chat window opens only if a name is entered
  - [x] List of "logged" in users is displayed.
  - [x] User list is refreshed in real time if new users join or when existing users leave
  - [x] Real time update of the chat window
  - [x] When new user joins, existing list of users and chat history until that point are displayed to the new user in the chat window
  - [x] Works in Opera, Firefox, Chrome and Edge

### Areas to Improve: (that I know of for now)
  - Code could do with some refactoring
  - Chat window styling could be improved
