# Challenges for 19-May:

### Split on Value

>Create  splitOnVal(list,num) that, given a number, splits a list in two. The latter half of the list should be returned, starting with node containing num.
>E.g.:  splitOnVal(5) for the list (1=>3=>5=>2=>4)  will change list to  (1=>3) , and the return value will be (5=>2=>4) .

### Partition

>Create partition(listNode,value) that locates the first node with that value, and moves all nodes with values less than that value to be earlier, and all nodes with values greater than that value to be later. Otherwise, original order need not be perfectly preserved. Return the new head listNode.
