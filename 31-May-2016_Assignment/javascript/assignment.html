// Taco Truck
//
// Joe drives a taco truck in the booming town of Squaresburg. He uses an array of  [x,y]  coordinates corresponding to locations of his customers. They walk to his truck, but he is fair-minded so he wants to minimize total distance from truck to customers. City blocks are perfect squares, and every street is two-way, at perfect right angles. He only parks by street corners (coordinates like  [37,-16] ). Customers only travel on streets: coordinate  [2,-2]  is distance  4  from  [0,0] . Joe checks the array before deciding where to park. Given a customer coordinate array, return an optimal taco truck location. Example: given  [ [10,0], [-1,-10], [2,4] ] , return  [2,0] , as total distance is  25  ( 8 + 13 + 4 ).

// steps:
// 1. seperate the location array into two different arrays - 1 for x coordinates and 1 for y coordinates
// 2. Identify the max and min for x and y coords
// 3. For every value between the max and min of X, subtract it from every x coordinate and then sum them up to find distance to be travelled. This will help identify minimum x distance to be travelled
// 4. Similarly find minimum y distance to be travelled
// 5. The value of X and Y where the minimum distance was identified will now the truck coords
