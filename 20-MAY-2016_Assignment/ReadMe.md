# Challenges for 20-May:

## Second to Last Value

> Create a standalone function that, given a pointer to the first node in a singly-linked list, will return the second-to-last value in that list. If the list isn't long enough, return  null .

## Filter

> Given a  headNode ,  lowVal  and  highVal , remove from the list any nodes that have values less than  lowVal  or higher than  highVal . Return the new list.

## Remove Single Node (Challenging!)

> Create a function  removeNode(node)  that takes in a pointer to only a single node (i.e. you don't have a pointer to the list itself) and remove it.
â€¢Here's a hint: You could be provided any node in the list except the last node.

### *Adding these methods to the classes defined in the 17-MAY-2016 Assignment*
  + *the method for last one is added but because of the challenge, it doesn't make use of HEAD node or track the prev node for removal. HEAD is used only for identifying the node to be removed.*
